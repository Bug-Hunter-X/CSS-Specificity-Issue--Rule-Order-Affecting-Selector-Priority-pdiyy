The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an unusual issue related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

In most cases, the more specific selector (`div p`) would override the less specific selector (`p`). However, in some browsers or situations involving dynamically generated content, the order of rules in the CSS file might affect how this specificity works.  The `p` rule could unexpectedly override the `div p` rule if the `p` rule is declared after the `div p` rule, even though `div p` is more specific.

This is not a standard CSS behavior but can occur due to implementation differences in how browsers process CSS and handle cascading.
